        <h1>DIY: Home Decor Ideas to Refresh Your Space on a Budget</h1>

<p>Transforming your living space doesn’t have to be expensive or complicated. With a little creativity and some basic tools, you can give your home a brand-new vibe while reflecting your personality. Here are some fun, affordable, and beginner-friendly DIY decor ideas you can try right away.</p>

<h2>1. Mason Jar Organizers</h2>
<p>Upcycle old mason jars into chic organizers for your bathroom, kitchen, or study table. Just paint the jars, label them, and mount them on a wooden board for a rustic yet modern touch.</p>

<h2>2. DIY Photo Wall</h2>
<p>Print your favorite photos, quotes, or travel memories and hang them using fairy lights or a string with clips. It’s a cozy way to personalize your space while showcasing your best memories.</p>

<h2>3. Painted Plant Pots</h2>
<p>Give boring terracotta pots a colorful makeover with acrylic paint. Add patterns, gradients, or inspirational quotes. It not only looks great but encourages indoor greenery, which boosts mood and productivity.</p>

<h2>4. Washi Tape Wall Art</h2>
<p>Use washi tape to create geometric shapes, minimalist artwork, or fake “frames” on your walls. It’s removable, damage-free, and super aesthetic — perfect for rented spaces or hostels.</p>

<h2>5. DIY Tech Nook</h2>
<p>Set up a clean, tech-friendly corner using things you already have. Wrap cables with colorful thread for a neater look, use cardboard boxes as drawer organizers, and decorate your workspace with self-made canvas art or motivational quotes.</p>

<h2>6. Floating Bookshelves</h2>
<p>Mount old hardcover books (yes, books!) on brackets to create invisible floating shelves. Add plants, mini photo frames, or candles to complete the cozy look.</p>

<h2>Bonus Tip: Use Smart Lighting</h2>
<p>Blend tech and decor by using LED strip lights or smart bulbs. They’re easy to install and instantly enhance your room’s mood — whether it’s for relaxing or late-night coding sessions.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p> DIY decor is all about being resourceful and creative. You don’t need to spend a fortune to make your space feel like “you.” Start with one idea and watch how it transforms your vibe and productivity!</p>
